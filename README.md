Moves in squared strings problem in codewars by javascript

Breaking It Down:
return: This means we're giving something back from the function. It’s like saying, "Here's the result!"
arr: This is a variable that represents an array (a list of things). In our context, it's a list of strings (like words).
.: This is an operator that lets us use a method on arr. Here, we’re using the map method.
map(: This is a method that goes through each item in arr and does something to it. It’s like saying, "For each toy in my toy box, do this."
(str, i):
str: This is a variable representing the current string (or word) from the array.
i: This represents the index (or position) of the current string in the array, starting from 0 (like counting your toys).
=>: This is an arrow that means "then do this." It’s like saying, "After I pick a toy, now I’m going to do something with it."
str.replace(: This uses the replace method on the current string (str). It’s like saying, "Change something in this toy."
/./g:
/: Starts a regular expression (a way to find patterns in text).
.: Means "any character" (like any letter or number).
g: Stands for "global," meaning to find all matches in the string, not just the first one.
,: This separates the arguments for the replace method.
(_, j):
_: This is a placeholder for the first argument (the matched character) that we don’t need, so we use _ to ignore it.
j: This is the index of the character we found with the replace method, starting from 0.
=>: Again, this means "then do this" for the next part.
arr[j][i]:
arr[j]: This gets the string at index j from the original array.
[i]: This gets the character at index i from that string.
So together, arr[j][i] means, "Get the character from the string at position j and from the i position."
Summary
So, this entire line of code is going through each word in the array, looking at each character, and replacing it with a character from a different position, effectively rotating or transforming the strings based on their positions in the array. It’s like taking each toy, looking at it, and then putting a different toy in its place based on a special rule!
